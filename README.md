# TimeSeriesMultiReg
This repo is a collaboration between Arun Kuppam and Aaron Hellman whose stated goal is to automate 5 machine learning algorithms, apply them to an inputted daily data set and output the ones with the best MAPE.

Inputs: An array with column 1 as daily dates, column N as the forecast Y variables and any number of columns from 2 to N-1 as regressor variables; number of days to forecast.

Output: 2D array of forecasted variables 

ToDo:
* update the Functions to have an option to be Region agnostic
